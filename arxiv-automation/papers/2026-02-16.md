Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\%$ and token usage by up to $93\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Effective and generalizable control in video generation remains a significant challenge. While many methods rely on ambiguous or task-specific signals, we argue that a fundamental disentanglement of "appearance" and "motion" provides a more robust and scalable pathway. We propose FlexAM, a unified framework built upon a novel 3D control signal. This signal represents video dynamics as a point cloud, introducing three key enhancements: multi-frequency positional encoding to distinguish fine-grained motion, depth-aware positional encoding, and a flexible control signal for balancing precision and generative quality. This representation allows FlexAM to effectively disentangle appearance and motion, enabling a wide range of tasks including I2V/V2V editing, camera control, and spatial object editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexAM achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Universal video understanding requires modeling fine-grained visual and audio information over time in diverse real-world scenarios. However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by video-instruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with single- and multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, a scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, a video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and is competitive with Gemini-3-Pro.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Classical autonomous driving systems connect perception and prediction modules via hand-crafted bounding-box interfaces, limiting information flow and propagating errors to downstream tasks. Recent research aims to develop end-to-end models that jointly address perception and prediction; however, they often fail to fully exploit the synergy between appearance and motion cues, relying mainly on short-term visual features. We follow the idea of "looking backward to look forward", and propose MASAR, a novel fully differentiable framework for joint 3D detection and trajectory forecasting compatible with any transformer-based 3D detector. MASAR employs an object-centric spatio-temporal mechanism that jointly encodes appearance and motion features. By predicting past trajectories and refining them using guidance from appearance cues, MASAR captures long-term temporal dependencies that enhance future trajectory forecasting. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate MASAR's effectiveness, showing improvements of over 20% in minADE and minFDE while maintaining robust detection performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/aminmed/MASAR.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) offers detailed evaluation of cardiac structure and function, but its limited accessibility restricts use to selected patient populations. In contrast, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitous and inexpensive, and provides rich information on cardiac electrical activity and rhythm, yet offers limited insight into underlying cardiac structure and mechanical function. To address this, we introduce a contrastive learning framework that improves the extraction of clinically relevant cardiac phenotypes from ECG by learning from paired ECG-CMR data. Our approach aligns ECG representations with 3D CMR volumes at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES), with a dual-phase contrastive loss to anchor each ECG jointly with both cardiac phases in a shared latent space. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D CMR representations with or without a temporal component, our framework models 3D anatomy at both ED and ES phases as distinct latent representations, enabling flexible disentanglement of structural and functional cardiac properties. Using over 34,000 ECG-CMR pairs from the UK Biobank, we demonstrate improved extraction of image-derived phenotypes from ECG, particularly for functional parameters ($\uparrow$ 9.2\%), while improvements in clinical outcome prediction remained modest ($\uparrow$ 0.7\%). This strategy could enable scalable and cost-effective extraction of image-derived traits from ECG. The code for this research is publicly available.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Wake vortices are strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft, and they pose a major safety and capacity challenge for air traffic management. Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

State-of-the-art rigging methods assume a canonical rest pose--an assumption that fails for sequential data (e.g., animal motion capture or AIGC/video-derived mesh sequences) that lack the T-pose. Applied frame-by-frame, these methods are not pose-invariant and produce topological inconsistencies across frames. Thus We propose SPRig, a general fine-tuning framework that enforces cross-frame consistency losses to learn pose-invariant rigs on top of existing models. We validate our approach on rigging using a new permutation-invariant stability protocol. Experiments demonstrate SOTA temporal stability: our method produces coherent rigs from challenging sequences and dramatically reduces the artifacts that plague baseline methods. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on a heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify a mismatch between SLA and a direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) a learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) a more faithful and direct sparse-linear attention formulation that uses a learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) a sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Predicting future clinical events from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to sparse multi-type clinical events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate when reasoning over long structured histories. We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes.

We study how to improve large foundation vision-language-action (VLA) systems through online reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world settings. Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

We present Unified Latent Dynamics (ULD), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that unifies the efficiency of model-free methods with the representational strengths of model-based approaches, without incurring planning overhead. By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

AI Video Assistant emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) deployed in the cloud. This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops.   To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video." Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms. We will release the benchmark and codes at https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Self-attention is often viewed as probabilistic query-key lookup, motivating designs that preserve normalized attention scores and fixed positional semantics. We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Due to sensor limitations, environments that off-road mobile robots operate in are often only partially observable. As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Distinguishing the feel of smooth silk from coarse cotton is a trivial everyday task for humans. When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Designing suitable rewards poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially for embodied manipulation. Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.

Effective water resource management depends on accurate projections of flows in water channels. For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to optimize decision-making policies under constraint conditions, making it highly applicable to safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and power grid management. However, existing robust CRL approaches predominantly focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations. To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

The successor representation (SR) provides a powerful framework for decoupling predictive dynamics from rewards, enabling rapid generalisation across reward configurations. However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.

Neural operators have emerged as fast surrogate solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are pivotal in processing dynamic graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.

<summary><b>摘要 (Abstract)</b></summary>

Relational deep learning (RDL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning directly on relational databases by modeling entities and their relationships across multiple interconnected tables. As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress. In this paper, we introduce RelBench v2, a major expansion of the RelBench benchmark for RDL. RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that RDL models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, highlighting the importance of modeling relational structure explicitly.
